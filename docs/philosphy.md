## Core Principle

Remove friction between thought and execution.
Every interface interaction should be keyboard-first.
Minimize hand movement and context switching.

## Motivation

Modern interfaces optimize for pointing devices.
They fragment attention through small, frequent interactions.
During focused work, these interruptions break flow.
Reaching for a mouse, switching context, or breaking hand position introduces friction.

## Approach

Apply vimish navigation everywhere.
Use universal keybinds across applications.
Compose simple tools into a coherent system.
Eliminate unnecessary transitions.

## Implementation

Keyboard-only workflow means removing friction wherever possible.
It does not mean rigid or extreme.
It means predictable, composable shortcuts.
It means minimal thinking about the interface.
It means maximum focus on the work.

## Result

A system where the interface imposes zero unnecessary transitions.
Where deep work depends on uninterrupted thought.
Where tools compose into a learnable, coherent whole.
