Configure macOS scroll speed to reduce mouse dependency.
Faster scrolling means fewer gestures.
Fewer gestures mean less friction.

## System Settings

Open System Settings → Mouse (or Trackpad).
Adjust scrolling speed slider.
Test and iterate until comfortable.
Higher values reduce the number of scroll gestures needed.

## Terminal Scroll Speed

Some terminal emulators have independent scroll settings.
Ghostty allows per-terminal scroll configuration.
Match terminal scroll speed to system scroll speed for consistency.

## Philosophy

Scroll speed is a friction point.
Too slow requires many gestures.
Too fast loses precision.
Find the balance that minimizes gestures while maintaining control.
