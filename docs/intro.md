**hackfast** is a modular, beginner-friendly guide for operating your machine with minimal interface friction.

everything is vimish. a distro for productivity

---

problems:
each app has set of cmds for each app
i hate my mouse
coconut oil is nice in nvim, why not make it nice everywhere?

solution:
universal cmds +  binds for every app 
vim everywhere

The name reflects the intent:
work faster by removing unnecessary barriers between you and your work.
hacking your mac to work faster

this will work for both mac and linux distros, but the focus here is using macos.

>why not linux

because i care about my time

> why not windows

windows is terrible

## Motivation

Modern interfaces optimize for pointing devices.
They fragment attention through small, frequent interactions.

During focused work—especially programming—these interruptions matter.
Reaching for a mouse, switching context, locating UI elements, or breaking hand position
introduces friction between thought and execution.

This project started from a simple observation:
flow breaks are often caused by interface mechanics, not by the work itself.

---

## Background

The transition began with a split keyboard several years ago.
That reduced physical friction.
Learning Vim later reduced navigational friction.

The larger realization came afterward:
if deep work depends on uninterrupted thought,
then the interface must impose *zero* unnecessary transitions.

Keyboard-first tools already exist.
Most applications already expose shortcuts.
What was missing was a coherent, learnable system that ties everything together.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to provide a practical path to a keyboard-only workflow:

- Minimal hand movement
- Minimal thinking
- Maxiumim flying
- No dependency on a mouse or trackpad
- Predictable, composable shortcuts
- Fast to set up
- Easy to learn incrementally

“Keyboard-only” here does not mean rigid or extreme.
It means removing friction wherever possible.

## Result

After focused iteration and refinement, this repository emerged.
