## Dev Workspace

Workspace 2 is dedicated to development.
It typically runs:

- tmux for terminal multiplexing
- nvim for editing
- ranger for file navigation
- btop for system monitoring
- ollama or opencode for AI assistance
- scratch buffers for quick notes

tmux is used only for dev work.
Other workspaces use native application windows.
